# Free and Open Source
The complete Organic Maps project codebase and all associated tools, documents and resources are released as free-as-in-freedom software using Free Software licenses[^1]. OM doesn't require contributors to assign their copyrights, so that changing to a proprietary license is hardly possible.

All data comes from open sources[^2] (e.g. map data is based on OpenStreetMap).

We strive to use FOSS tools and platfroms for collaboration when possible. There are some notable exceptions, e.g. Github (https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/7059). Contributors are free to use whatever individual tools they're used to (e.g. proprietary IDEs).

[^1]: At the moment non-F-Droid Android builds of OM contain a proprietary Google Play Services Location library, which possibly could be replaced by a FOSS implementation in the future (see #9916).
Please let us know if you spot any other non-free bits.

# Privacy
All personal information is protected by default to a reasonable extent.
There are additional options for sensitive users to further enhance protection by sacrificing some convenience / ease of use.

No personal information is collected without user's explicit consent.
Organic Maps might collect anonymous usage statistics in a privacy-preserving way. These stats couldn't possibly be used to identify or track a user.

The project pledges to disclose all potential limitations of data protection and reasons for anonymous data collection.

The project might explore various monetization options, but all of them should be done in a way to preserve privacy, honor, dignity, and respect for users.

# Community
The Organic Maps project is based on a community of volunteer contributors and strives to be user-centric.

The project endeavours to have little hierarchy in its governance and strives to conduct as much discussion in public as possible.
